    // we are going to have 3 set topics which you can choose at start of round
    // each topic is an array

    // topics
    // movies [top 250 off imdb]
    // bands [top 500 billboard artists]
    // world capitals [idk how many there are]


    // var userChoice = event.click.topicsChoice???
    // from userChoice, java chooses random floor number based from 0-topicChoice.length

    // use this number to find the item in chosen topics array.

    // define this as var compWord = chosenTopic[randomnumber]

    // create a loop to display a '_' for each letter of word unless there is a space in the word's string.

    // we need a few more variables

    // gamescore[w,l]

    // if var wrongGuess = 6 then user loses round.  Add a loss to gamescore.

    // if all letters are guessed and wrongGuess >= 5 then user wins round.  Add a win to gamescore.
    // also need to display each correct letter, replacing the '_' from earlier.

    // HOW DO I SPLIT A STRING!!!!!!!
