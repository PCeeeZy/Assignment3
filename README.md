Psychic-Game and Word Guess Game

This assignment has been tough.
Despite not finishing hangman, I'm happy I bit off a lot.  It challenged me to try harder than just follow the tutorials online word for word.  I feel like my confort level with javascript improved a lot during these assignments and I'm sure on another go I can do better.

My main struggles with psychic:
I had a hard time figuring out the order of operations so to speak.
I had to spend a lot of time trying a declaration in one area just to eventually learn after many attempts in belongs elsewhere.
For many hours this caused any letter input to be a win, despite its correctness.
Then I couldn't get wrong guesses to track properly.  Some ways I tried it would auto loss me, even when it was the correct letter.
Another struggle I had which ties into hangman is getting the keypress logged on screen.  I ended up passing on attempting this too much because I had already spent a lot of time tweaking this to make it work cleanly and wanted to allot more time for hangman.

My main struggles with Hangman:
I feel like theres only been one real struggle with this: converting a string into an indexed array where each index is its own single character string.  Then taking that and turning it into another indexed array where every letter is now an underscore. After a couple hours for past 3 days and 6 hours today trying to figure out new methods to approach and comprehend what I'm trying to do I give up and its still obviously not solved.

While I am upset that I have lost this battle and Hangman is unfinished I feel like besides these hangups, the remaining code that checks for compatibility and using the value of the buttons to make sense in my head.  With a few more days I feel confident I could complete that section of code.  The underscoring array on the other hand--I could use some definite help on that.

I also am proud of trying a way of completing Hangman in a way that was outside of most people's desires.  I didn't want to just use key events because I feel that has been done, is well documented, and can easily be copy-pasted from online sources with subtle variable name changes.  I wanted to build a fun and challenging game and I am very close to doing so.

This has also given me a good idea of what I can talk to Dart about in terms of a topic for setting up tutoring.

Thank you for taking the time to look through this as well as all the help thru slack.  I hope I outlined my work well.

Last shout outs to:
    Eddie, Anton, and Chris
        They have been big helps in helping my find my mistakes and try and help me to understand the underscore array.
